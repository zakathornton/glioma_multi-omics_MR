### Abstract
**Background:** Genetically predicted changes in molecular traits are associated with genetic liability to glioma risk. We sought to identify and provide evidence for the prioritisation of these traits using a combined two-sample Mendelian randomisation and colocalisation pipeline.

**Methods:** We used genetic variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to compare the effects of gene expression, protein abundance and splicing variation on genetic liability to glioma risk. We performed analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) (expression QTL [MetaBrain, n=4,119,012]; protein QTL [BrainQTL, n=786,632] and splicing QTL [GTEx, n=166,721]) derived from 15 different brain tissues and summary-level data from eight glioma GWAS (12,496 cases and 18,190 controls).

**Results:** We found robust evidence linking QTL for 25 genes in 15 loci with risk of glioma following relevant sensitivity analysis. We identified four novel genes putatively implicated in glioma risk: BTN3A2 (6p22.2), FAIM (3q22.3), GALNT6 (12q13.13) and GMPPB (3p21.31).

**Conclusions:** Identification of these novel genes may improve understanding in pathogenic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis and should be followed up in further studies, which may inform novel prevention studies following future clinical trials.
